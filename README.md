# FindMyBando

## The main concept of this project is to create a mobile app dedicated for those who are into the drone hobby, so they can login on the app(Android/IOS) and organizte meetup/events, chat with their friends, post pictures.

### Possible Functionalities:

1. Single sign on
2. An app that searches in real time for other FPV pilotes in case they choose to share their location (everyone/friends);
3. Users will be able to organize their meetups/events;
4. Users will be able to add new friends(pilots) and chat with other users;
5.
